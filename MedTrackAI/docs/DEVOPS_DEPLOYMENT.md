# DevOps Deployment Guide

## Project Overview

This comprehensive DevOps implementation provides enterprise-grade deployment capabilities for the MedTracker Pro medication tracking application. The infrastructure supports scalable, secure, and monitored deployments across multiple environments.

## Infrastructure Components

### 1. Containerization
- **Docker multi-stage builds** with Alpine Linux base for minimal attack surface
- **Security hardening** with non-root user execution and health checks
- **Container registry** integration with GitHub Container Registry

### 2. Orchestration
- **Kubernetes manifests** for production-ready deployments
- **Auto-scaling** configurations with resource limits and requests
- **Service mesh** ready architecture with proper networking

### 3. Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform modules** for AWS EKS, RDS, and ElastiCache
- **Environment separation** with staging and production configurations
- **State management** with remote backend support

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions** workflows with security scanning
- **Automated testing** and quality gates
- **Multi-environment deployments** with approval workflows

### 5. Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus metrics** collection with custom application metrics
- **Grafana dashboards** for real-time monitoring
- **Alert management** with notification channels

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required tools
- Docker 20.10+
- kubectl 1.24+
- terraform 1.5+
- aws-cli 2.0+
- helm 3.8+
```

### Quick Start
1. **Configure AWS credentials**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Deploy infrastructure**
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform plan -var="environment=production"
   terraform apply
   ```

3. **Deploy application**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh production
   ```

### Environment Configuration

#### Staging Environment
```bash
# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy.sh staging

# Access staging environment
kubectl get ingress -n medtracker-staging
```

#### Production Environment
```bash
# Deploy to production (requires approval)
./scripts/deploy.sh production

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n medtracker-production
curl -f https://api.medtracker.com/api/health
```

## Security Features

### Network Security
- WAF protection with rate limiting and SQL injection prevention
- SSL/TLS termination with automatic certificate management
- Network policies for pod-to-pod communication

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest for databases and storage
- Encryption in transit for all communications
- Secret management with AWS Secrets Manager

### Access Control
- RBAC policies for Kubernetes resources
- IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Service accounts with scoped access

## Monitoring and Observability

### Application Metrics
- Response time and throughput monitoring
- Error rate tracking and alerting
- Business metrics for medication adherence

### Infrastructure Metrics
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage)
- Network performance and connectivity
- Database performance and connections

### Alerting Rules
- High error rates or slow response times
- Resource exhaustion warnings
- Security incident notifications

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Pod autoscaling based on CPU and memory usage
- Database read replicas for increased throughput
- Redis clustering for cache distribution

### Vertical Scaling
- Resource limit adjustments based on usage patterns
- Database instance sizing recommendations
- Storage capacity planning

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Automated database backups with point-in-time recovery
- Configuration backup to version control
- Disaster recovery runbooks and procedures

### High Availability
- Multi-AZ deployments for database and cache
- Load balancer health checks and failover
- Cross-region replication capabilities

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Management
- Right-sizing recommendations based on usage metrics
- Spot instance utilization for non-critical workloads
- Reserved instance planning for predictable workloads

### Monitoring Costs
- CloudWatch cost tracking and alerts
- Resource utilization optimization
- Unused resource identification and cleanup

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Pod startup failures**
   - Check resource limits and requests
   - Verify secret availability
   - Review container logs

2. **Database connectivity**
   - Validate security group rules
   - Check endpoint accessibility
   - Verify credentials in secrets

3. **SSL certificate issues**
   - Confirm domain validation
   - Check certificate expiration
   - Verify DNS configuration

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n medtracker-production

# View pod logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/medtracker-app -n medtracker-production

# Access pod shell
kubectl exec -it deployment/medtracker-app -n medtracker-production -- /bin/sh

# Check service endpoints
kubectl get endpoints -n medtracker-production
```

## Performance Tuning

### Application Optimization
- Connection pooling configuration
